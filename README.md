# React + Tailwind CSS Template

A minimal React + Tailwind CSS setup with Vite for fast development.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehmughn/react-tailwindcss-setup my-project-name
cd my-project-name
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

```bash
node setup.js
```

The script will:

- Remove the `.git` folder (so you can initialize your own repository)
- Install all npm dependencies

### 3. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`

## After Setup

Don't forget to initialize a new git repository for your project:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
